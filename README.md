# Convenience Store Management System

## Background
A convenience store sells two groups of products: daily use products such as bread, dumplings, and sticky rice, and products with a long shelf life such as cookies, soft drinks, and filtered water. Product information is stored in the `product.dat` file, while import/export information is stored in the `wareHouse.dat` file.
